COMMENT ON VIEW inventory_item IS 
'This view is the canonical representation of an inventory item. 
It provides a unified way to reference a product in the system, 
with its core identity (product_id), its current operational price (live_price), 
and the last time the underlying product record was updated (last_update_time). 
Think of this as the "single source of truth" for inventory items within the business context.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN inventory_item.product_id IS 
'The unique identifier for the inventory item. 
This connects directly to the products table and allows other systems or queries to join consistently on a stable ID.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN inventory_item.live_price IS 
'The current selling price of the inventory item. 
It is not a fixed value in the products table but a property that reflects present business conditions. 
When another system or dashboard asks, "What is the price of this item right now?" â€” this is the field to use.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN inventory_item.last_update_time IS 
'The timestamp of the most recent update to the product record. 
This tells you how fresh the information is. 
If you are checking for stale data or debugging why a price looks off, this column is a good reference point.';
